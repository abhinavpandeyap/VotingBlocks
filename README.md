It is an E-Voting web application system based on Ethereum Blockchain Technology

# VotingBlocks
As we know,
We r going to make an e-voting Application (web)- "VotingBlocks"

So there are some concepts, tools  n technoligies which would be required in order to develop this application.
I know some of u dont want to make efforts in this but everyone should have atleast
Basic knowledge of Blockchain, Etherium and Cryptography, so that we can perform well as a team.

And those who are willing to work with me on this project seriously, will have to learn the following technologies as per their interest.

For front-end:-
photoshop,
HTML, 
CSS,
JavaScript,
React.js.

For back-end:-
Node.js,
npm packages.

Metamask- used to access your wallet on the ethereum by web browser through an extension.

Web3js- library which allows you to connect to local or remote ethereum node using HTTP/Web sockets.
