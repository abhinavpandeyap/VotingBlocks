It is an E-Voting web application system based on Ethereum Blockchain Technology

# VotingBlocks
As we know,
We r going to make an e-voting Application (web)- "VotingBlocks"

So there are some concepts, tools  n technoligies which would be required in order to develop this application.
I know some of u dont want to make efforts in this but everyone should have atleast
Basic knowledge of Blockchain, Etherium and Cryptography, so that we can perform well as a team.

And those who are willing to work with me on this project seriously, will have to learn the following technologies as per their interest.

For front-end:-
photoshop,
HTML, 
CSS,
JavaScript,
React.js.

For back-end:-
Node.js,
npm packages.

Solidity- to create Smart Contracts,

Ganache- to setup local blockchain network,

Truffle- development env on EVM,

Metamask- used to access your wallet on the ethereum by web browser through an extension.

Web3js- library which allows you to connect to local or remote ethereum node using HTTP/Web sockets.

Visual Studio Code- IDE for the front-end development. 



**#Follow these steps to run the Application:-**

1.Install node.js.

2.Install Ganache and run it to crate a local Blockchain Environment.

3.Install Metamask browser extension and Metamsk legacy web3 extension.

4.Install python and visual studio.

5.Install truffle by using this command in command prompt

    npm install truffle -g 

6.clone this repository and go to votingblocks directory


7. Compile & Deploy the smart contracts by using this command:-

    truffle migrate --reset

8. Run the server by using this command in command prompt

    npm run dev

9.Make sure that you have imported the same account provided by Ganache in the Metamask 
  and Metamask is connected to the site.


Remix- IDE to start with the basic setup in the browser itself.
